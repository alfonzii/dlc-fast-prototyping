# DLC Fast Prototyping

**DLC Fast Prototyping** is a lightweight framework for fast experimentation, benchmarking, and development of [Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs)](https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf) on Bitcoin.  
It allows testing various cryptographic configurations—such as ECDSA vs. Schnorr adaptor signatures—and running detailed benchmarks for performance analysis.


## Prerequisites

- Rust (recommended version: `cargo 1.85.0`)
- A Unix-like system is recommended (Linux/macOS)
    - or WSL 2 on Windows


## Running the Program
### Run with Baseline Configuration
To run the program with the baseline settings (ECDSA + simple method):
```
cargo run --release --features baseline
```
- `--release` enables compiler optimizations for realistic performance.

This will execute the DLC setup using ECDSA adaptor signatures and simple method for anticipation point computation, all running single-threadly.

### Run with Custom Features
To test specific configurations (e.g., using Schnorr adaptor signatures, basis method and enabling parallelism), specify the desired ones:
```
cargo run --release --features "enable-benchmarks, schnorr, parallel-cpt, basis-method"
```

Already implemented custom features (visible in `Cargo.toml`) to be tried out are:
- `ecdsa` - ECDSA adaptor signature scheme
- `schnorr` - Schnorr adaptor signature scheme (ECDSA or Schnorr must be used, not both nor neither)
- `simple-method` - simple atp point computation method (more straightforward implementation)
- `basis-method` - basis atp point computation method (faster for most cases)
- `parallel-cpt` - enable parallel computation of anticipation points and adaptor signatures
- `parallel-parser` - enable parallel creation of `ParsedContract` structure
- `enable-benchmarks` - enable full end-to-end benchmark thorough whole run of program, showing run time of individual DLC setup steps

> ⚠️ Warning for developers: To get rid of errors in your IDE for not using features, uncomment `default` feature in `Cargo.toml`. If you want to use `schnorr` or `basis-method` for developing purposes, then use `--no-default-feature` flag for successful compilation, to get rid of `ecdsa` and `simple-method` from default, or you can just comment `default` back.

## Additional Configuration
Parameters that are not controlled via feature flags are located in:
```
src/config.rs
```
What can be changed in `config.rs` file is following:
- Constants
    + `NB_DIGITS` - number of digits that outcome is using
    + `CONTRACT_INPUT_PATH` - path to contract from which we will be setting up DLC
- Type aliases
    + `MyOracle` - oracle type
    + `MyParser` - parser type


## Benchmarks
The framework supports both:
- **End-to-end DLC benchmarks** (via `enable-benchmarks` feature)
- **Function-specific math microbenchmarks** (via `math-bench.rs`)

### Run High-Level Benchmarks
To measure overall runtime of DLC creation and execution:
```
cargo run --release --features "enable-benchmarks, [CUSTOM FEATURES]"
```
Two key runtime bottlenecks typically emerge:

- `Init storage`

- `Verify adaptors`

These are analyzed further using fine-grained function-level benchmarking.

### Run Microbenchmarks (Function-level)

To benchmark individual functions in isolation:
```
cargo bench --bench math-bench --features "[CUSTOM FEATURES]"
```
This allows testing core cryptographic primitives.

> Only ecdsa or schnorr features are relevant for function-level benchmarks.

### Run Comparative Decision Benchmarks

During development, several alternative designs were benchmarked to guide decisions. These comparisons are available in:
```
benches/benchmark.rs
```
You can run them similarly:
```
cargo bench --bench benchmark --features "[CUSTOM FEATURES]"
```

## About

This framework was developed as part of the thesis project _“Practical Oracle-Based Bitcoin Payments”_.
The goal was to create a flexible, modular environment for evaluating and optimizing DLC protocol components—particularly focusing on cryptographic performance and protocol design.

For more details on the design rationale and performance analysis, please refer to the [thesis](https://google.com).

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:

- [@Tibo-lg](https://github.com/Tibo-lg) for his responsiveness, and work on [`rust-dlc`](https://github.com/p2pderivatives/rust-dlc), which laid the foundation for many of the ideas explored here.
- [@siv2r](https://github.com/siv2r) for implementing Schnorr adaptor signatures in C for `secp256k1-zkp`, and for his help to hasten up building Rust wrappers around them. His support made it possible to focus on the benchmarking framework without being blocked on low-level cryptographic integration.

This project would not have been possible without their help and contributions to the open-source DLC ecosystem.
